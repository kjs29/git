# Git commands

```
$ ls lets-git-it
```

This lets us see the files inside `lets-git-it` folder.

Example :

if folder structure is like 

```
desktop > programming > python >  first.py
                                  second.py
                                  third.py
```
And on terminal,

```
$ pwd

/Users/Jin/desktop/programming

$ ls python

first.py    second.py   third.py

$ cd ..

/Users/Jin/desktop/

$ ls programming/python

first.py    second.py   third.py
```

No matter where we are currently, we can still figure out what are inside the python folder.

---

```
$ git diff --cached
```

or

```
$ git diff --staged
```

This lets us see what we staged.
