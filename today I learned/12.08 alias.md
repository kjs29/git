# Alias

when we want to move to another branch we usually write 

```
$ git checkout second-branch
```

If we write this, we can create alias to save a little bit of time.

```
$ git config --global alias.co "checkout"
```

After that, we can just write

```
$ git co second-branch
```

# When we want to edit the last commit without having to commit again!

```
$ git commit -am --no-edit
```
