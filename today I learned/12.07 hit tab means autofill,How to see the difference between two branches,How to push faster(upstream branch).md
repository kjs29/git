# `Tab` button means that it will autofill.

On bash terminal, if I hit tab button, it will autofill.

```
$ git branch

```

If I type 

```
$ git checkout fe

and press tab, it will show

```
$ git checkout feature-readme-instructions

# How to see the difference between two branches

Let's say that we have two branches `master` and `feature-readme-instructions`.

```
$ git diff feature-readme-instructions
```

Then it will show something like this.

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

# How to push faster (Upstream branch)

How to set an upstream branch

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

or

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
```

After this set up, we can now push(upload) on github a lot faster. Before this, we have to manually type this all the time.

- Before we had to type this code every time we pushed.
```
$ git push origin master
```

- Now we can just type

```
$ git push
```


## This applies to `pull` too.

If we didn't set up upstream, then I have to type this

```
$ git pull --set-upstream origin master
```

From then on now we can just type

```
$ git pull
```

to pull repository from github to local repository.


### Notice that for the pull upstream branch setup, we can't use `-u`.

```
$ git pull -u origin master
```

This code doesn't work.

### Once we set up upstream branch in push side, `$ git pull` will work. Vice versa.

```
# set up upstream in push side
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kjs29/zzzzz.git
$ git push -u origin master

# now pull works fast
$ git pull
```

```
# set up upstream in pull side
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kjs29/zzzzz.git
$ git pull --set-upstream origin master

# now push works fast
$ git push
```
