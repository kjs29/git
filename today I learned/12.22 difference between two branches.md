# How to see the difference between two branches

When multiple people work with gits, they work might have to see the difference between two branches.

It is always a good practice to get the most up-to-date master branch version by 

```
$ git pull
```

# To see the difference between two branches called `master` and `side1`

```
$ git diff master..side1
```
