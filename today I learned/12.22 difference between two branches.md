# How to see the difference between two branches

When multiple people work with gits, they work might have to see the difference between two branches.

It is always a good practice to get the most up-to-date master branch version by 

```
$ git pull
```

Let's say there is a file called `newfile.md`.

In branch `master`

```
this is new file.
```

In branch `oldbranch`

```
this is old file.
```

### To see the difference between two branches called `master` and `oldbranch`

```
$ git diff master..oldbranch
```

Then it will show the difference between `master`'s version and `oldbranch`'s version.

And `master`'s version will be compared to the `oldbranch`'s version.

Result:

```
diff --git a/newfile.md b/newfile.md
index eb0d7d4..99a4edb 100644
--- a/newfile.md
+++ b/newfile.md
@@ -1 +1 @@
-this is new file.
\ No newline at end of file
+this is old file.
\ No newline at end of file
diff --git a/newfile.txt b/newfile.txt
deleted file mode 100644
index e69de29..0000000
```

If we wrote 

```
$ git diff oldbranch..master
```

Then it will show something like this

```
diff --git a/newfile.md b/newfile.md
index 99a4edb..eb0d7d4 100644
--- a/newfile.md
+++ b/newfile.md

\ No newline at end of file
diff --git a/newfile.txt b/newfile.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
```

Here, it shows that 

```
-this is old file.
...
+this is new file.
```

because `master` has `this is new file.`, and `oldbranch` has `this is old file.`
