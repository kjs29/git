# Today I learned...

# Copy files

If there was a file named "hello.py"

```py
print("hello")
```

and I want to copy this file and name it like 'print_hello.py'

Then in terminal I can write like 

```
$ cp hello.py print_hello.py
```

Then it will create a same file named `print_hello.py`


# Diffing files

Let's say there are two files 

<em>menu1.txt</em>

```
Apples
Bananas
Cranberries
```

<em>menu2.txt</em>

```
Apples
Bananas
Grapes
```

What if we want to compare the difference in these two files?

We can surely have them both on side by side and compare with our eyes... but we have this amazing command that helps us to see the difference on the spot!

```
$ diff menu1.txt menu2.txt
```

```
3c3
< Cranberries
\ No newline at end of file
---
> Grapes
\ No newline at end of file
```

`<` : lines from the first file
`>` : lines from the second file
`a` : added the text to file
`c` : changes are made in the file
`d` : deletion operation is performed

In the result above shown, `3c3` means the third line in the first file (`3`) is changed(`c`) to the third line in the second file (`3`). And the `Cranberries` is removed from the first file, and the `Grapes` is added to the second file.

In other words, the old line got replaced by the new one.

### Let's look at another diff example.

There are two files.

<em>do_list.txt</em>

```
I need to do this
I will clean
I will walk the dog
I will do the laundry
```

<em>do_list1.txt</em>

```
I need to do this
I will study
I will attend developers meetings
I will read
```

If I run a command,

```
$ diff do_list.txt do_list1.txt
```

```
2,4c2,4
< I will clean
< I will walk the dog
< I will do the laundry
\ No newline at end of file
---
> I will study
> I will attend developers meetings
> I will read
\ No newline at end of file
```

In the result above, we can see that `2,4c2,4`.

`2,4c2,4` can be broken into `2,4` + `c` + `2,4`

This means from the line 2 to the line 4 in the first file are changed to match the line 2 to the line 4 in the second file.

```
< I will clean
< I will walk the dog
< I will do the laundry
```

This means that the line 2,3,4 from the first file are removed.

```
> I will study
> I will attend developers meetings
> I will read
\ No newline at end of file
```

This means that the line 2,3,4 from the second file are added.

### Sometimes if we have more complicated codes, we'd have to look at the whole context to understand the difference.

In this case we use unified format

```
diff -u firstfile.py secondfile.py
```

# Creating a new file with contents of differences

Let's say there are two files.

<em>groceries1.txt</em>

```
Apples
Bananas
Pineapples
Grapes
```

<em>groceries2.txt</em>

```
Apples
Watermelons
Pineapples
Pumpkins
```

We already learned that seeing the differences in two files is done by 

```
$ diff groceries1.txt groceries2.txt
```

And we can create a new file called `changes.diff` with the differences by 

```
$ diff groceries1.txt groceries2.txt > change.diff
```

This will create a new file containing the differences.

<em>change.diff</em>

```
2c2
< Bananas
---
> Watermelons
4c4
< Grapes
\ No newline at end of file
---
> Pumpkins
\ No newline at end of file

```

Depending on the case, it would be necessary for us to add unified format in the file. More context is helpful for the people who read the file.

```
$ diff -u groceries1.txt groceries2.txt > u_change.diff
```

<em>u_change.diff</em>

### Using patch we can apply the changes

```
$ patch groceries1.txt < u_change.dff
```

Now `groceries1.txt` looks like this.

```
Apples
Bananas
Pineapples
Grapes
```
