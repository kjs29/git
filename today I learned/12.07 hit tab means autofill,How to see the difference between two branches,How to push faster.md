# `Tab` button means that it will autofill.

On bash terminal, if I hit tab button, it will autofill.

```
$ git branch

```
* feature-readme-instructions

If I type 

```
$ git checkout fe

and press tab, it will show

```
$ git checkout feature-readme-instructions

# How to see the difference between two branches

Let's say that we have two branches `master` and `feature-readme-instructions`.

```
$ git diff feature-readme-instructions
```

Then it will show something like this.

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 8eeb07f..9ffa065 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md

# How to push faster

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

or

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
```

After this we can now push(upload) on github a lot faster, before this, we have to manually type this all the time.

```
$ git push origin master
```

This applies to `pull` too.

If we didn't set up upstream, then I have to type this

```
$ git pull origin master
```

From then on now we can just type

```
$ git pull
```

to pull repository from github to local repository.
