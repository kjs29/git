# 12/06 Today I learned...

# HEAD commit

Head commit = the commit that we are currently on


# Difference between `$ git checkout` and `$ git reset`


```
$ git reset HEAD <filename>
```

This removes a file from staging area


```
$ git checkout HEAD <filename>
```

What this does is moving their HEAD commit to the previous version.
