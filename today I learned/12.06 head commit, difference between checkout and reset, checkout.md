# HEAD commit

Head commit = the commit that we are currently on


# Difference between `$ git checkout` and `$ git reset`

[useful link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)

---

```
$ git reset HEAD <filename>
```

This removes a file from staging area

---

```
$ git checkout HEAD <filename>
```

What this does is moving their version to current committed (HEAD) version.

```
$ git checkout HEAD .
```

This will move all their unstaged changes back to current committed version(HEAD).

---


```
$ git revert HEAD
```

Undo the commit, while we can still see the history.

# `$ git checkout ~`


If you type 

```
$ git log --oneline
```

this shows all the recent `commit_SHA` and commit messages.

```

```

If you want to go back to `35a8bea` version,

you can simply type

```
$ git checkout 35a8bea .
```

Notice that there is `.` !

You can also check out only a specific file by typing

```
$ git checkout 35a8bea README.md
```
