# HEAD commit

Head commit = the commit that we are currently on


# Difference between `$ git checkout` and `$ git reset`

[useful link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)

```
$ git reset HEAD <filename>
```

This removes a file from staging area


```
$ git checkout HEAD <filename>
```

What this does is moving their HEAD commit to the previous version.


```
$ git revert HEAD
```

Undo the commit, while we can still see the history.
