## We should be careful when we clone the github repository into local computer

When we want to clone github repository into local repository using

```
$ git clone <url of the local repository>
```

Filenames on github should 

- NOT include `?`
- NOT include `*`
- NOT end with `.`

Otherwise it will only create the empty directory with `.git`.


So before cloning, we should change the filenames on github.
